## Stages
**Stage #1 Initial setup.**  
Learn how to work with the field and the coordinates.

**Stage #2 Easy does it.**  
Make an easy difficulty level where the computer just makes random moves: simple to make and not too challenging to beat.

**Stage #3 Watch 'em fight**  
Whether you want to play with a friend or take a break and watch computers battle it out, you can do both!

**Stage #4 Signs of intelligence**  
Letâ€™s create a medium difficulty level. This AI should be a lot harder to beat! Are you up to the challenge?

**Stage #5 An undefeated champion**  
Oh no, what have we created here? An unbeatable AI monster! Indeed, this complex algorithm guarantees a win or a draw.
